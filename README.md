### Overview

**TinyTransformer4TS** is a unified, end-to-end framework for deploying **integer-only quantized Transformer models** on **low-power embedded FPGAs**. It supports **three core time-series tasks** (one-step ahead forecasting, classification, and threshold-based anomaly detection) and automates the entire pipeline from training to RTL synthesis.

This repository provides:
- 🔧 Full support for model **training and quantization-aware training (QAT)**
- 🧱 Automated **RTL code generation and FPGA synthesis** for deployment
- ⚙️ Integrated **hardware-aware hyperparameter optimization** using Optuna

> ⚠️ This repository works in tandem with our [ElasticAI.Creator](https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.creator/tree/add-linear-quantization) library, which provides the core VHDL templates and quantization modules for hardware generation. Please make sure to install it as part of the setup process.

### Supported FPGA Platforms
This framework targets ultra-small, low-power FPGAs, making it ideal for on-device edge AI deployment:

| FPGA Platform	Model  | Used in Papers | Frequency | Resource Budges               |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| AMD Spartan-7 Series | XC7S15         | 100 MHz   | 8,000 LUTs, 10 BRAMs, 20 DSPs |
| Lattice iCE40 Series | UP5K           | 16 MHz    | 5,280 LUTs, 30 EBRs, 8 DSPs   |

Deployment scripts and bitstreams for both platforms are included. 
> **Radiant Path Configuration:** If you plan to deploy models to the Lattice iCE40 platform, please **make sure to update the toolchain paths** used in the automation scripts: In `optuna_utils/radiant_runner.py` and `scripts/hw_analysis_pipeline.sh`, replace the hardcoded path `/home/tianhengling/lscc/radiant/2023.2/bin/lin64` with the path to your own Radiant installation directory. You can typically find your Radiant install path by checking the environment variable `RADIANT_PATH` or by locating the executable manually.
